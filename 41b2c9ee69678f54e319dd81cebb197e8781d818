Hence, this PR will be abandoned in favor of the new one.\n\nAll review comments have been addressed in the new PR, except for adding this keyword to another test case (Verify SSH Login Access With Admin User). A separate PR will be raised to fix that.\n\nKindly review the newly created PR.",

      "message": "During test case execution, the keyword \"Create Admin User And Verify SSH Login\" performs the following operations:\n\nStep 1: Creates a new user and logs in via Redfish.\n\nStep 2: Opens an SSH connection using the newly created user and then closes it.\n\nStep 3: The newly created user remains logged in via Redfish, so the delete operation does not work.\n\nTherefore, to delete the newly created user, you must log in as the root user via Redfish and then delete the user.",
