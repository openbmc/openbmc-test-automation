      "message": "@sridevra@in.ibm.com I don\u0027t think this is a problem. If you take a look at the test, it does not use real users, it creates test users with different roles (Administrator, Operator and ReadOnly) on setup stage, in test body reboots BMC and checks the created users still persist, and on tear down stage removes created test users.\n\n@gkeishin@gmail.com I think this will not do what I want. If I do what I suggest, I will be able to combine code to one block, but not the behavior. What I\u0027m trying to achieve here is - speed up test by eliminating multiple reboots. Currently, the code creates admin_user, reboots BMC, check it exists and removes it, then do the same for operator_user and then for the readonly_user one. What you suggest is to keep the behavior, my change changes the logic - create all the users, reboot once, check they still exist and remove. This way I save time taken by 2 additional reboots.",
