## Supported Systems Architecture

OpenBMC test infrastructure is proven capable of running on:

- POWER
- x86 systems running OpenBMC firmware stack.

## Testing Setup Steps

To verify the installation setup is completed and ready to execute.

- Download the openbmc-test-automation repository:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-test-automation
  $ cd openbmc-test-automation
  ```

- Execute basic setup test run:

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx templates/test_openbmc_setup.robot
  ```

  where xx.xx.xx.xx is the BMC hostname or IP.

## Test Layout

There are several sub-directories within the openbmc-test-automation base which
contain test suites, tools, templates, etc. These sub-directories are classified
as follows:

`docs/`: Contains the documentation related to OpenBMC.

`redfish/`: Contains the general test cases for OpenBMC stack functional
verification.

`systest/`: Contains test cases for HTX bootme testing.

`xcat/`: Contains test cases for XCAT automation.

`gui/test/`: Contains test cases for testing web-based interface built on
AngularJS.

`gui/gui_test/`: Contains test cases for testing web-based user interface built
on Vue.js.

`pldm/`: Contains test cases for platform management subsystem (base, bios, fru,
platform, OEM).

`snmp/`: Contains test cases for SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
configuration testing.

`openpower/`: Contains test cases for an OpenPOWER based system.

`tools/`: Contains various tools.

`templates/`: Contains sample code examples and setup testing.

`test_list/`: Contains the argument files used for skipping test cases (e.g
"skip_test", "skip_test_extended", etc.) or grouping them (e.g "HW_CI",
"CT_basic_run", etc.).

## Redfish Test Layout

OpenBMC is moving steadily towards DTMF Redfish, which is an open industry
standard specification and schema that meets the expectations of end users for
simple, modern and secure management of scalable platform hardware.

`redfish/`: Contains test cases for DMTF Redfish-related feature supported on
OpenBMC.

`redfish/extended/`: Contains test cases for combined DMTF Redfish-related
feature supported on OpenBMC. Some of the test will be deprecated.

Note: Work in progress test development parameter
`-v REDFISH_SUPPORT_TRANS_STATE:1` to force the test suites to execute in
redfish mode only.

## Quickstart

To run openbmc-automation first you need to install the prerequisite Python
packages which will help to invoke tests through tox (Note that tox version
2.3.1 or greater is required) or via Robot CLI command.

**Robot Command Line**

- Execute all test suites for `redfish/` and `ipmi/`:

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx  redfish  ipmi
  ```

- Execute a test suite:

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx redfish/extended/test_basic_ci.robot
  ```

- Initialize the following test variables which will be used during test
  execution:

  User can forward declare as environment variables:

  ```
  $ export OPENBMC_HOST=<openbmc machine IP address/hostname>
  $ export OPENBMC_USERNAME=<openbmc username>
  $ export OPENBMC_PASSWORD=<openbmc password>
  $ export IPMI_COMMAND=<Dbus/External>
  ```

  or

  User can input as robot variables as part of the CLI command:

  ```
  -v OPENBMC_HOST:<openbmc machine IP address/hostname>
  -v OPENBMC_USERNAME:<openbmc username>
  -v OPENBMC_PASSWORD:<openbmc password>
  ```

- Testing in qemu:

  Set extra environment variables:

  ```
  $ export SSH_PORT=<ssh port number>
  $ export HTTPS_PORT=<https port number>
  ```

  Run the QEMU CI test suite:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=xx.xx.xx.xx SSH_PORT=<port number> HTTPS_PORT=<port number> robot -A test_lists/QEMU_CI  redfish/ ipmi/
  ```

- Run tests:

- How to run an individual test:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=xx.xx.xx.xx tox -e default -- --include Test_SSH_And_IPMI_Connections redfish/extended/test_basic_ci.robot
  ```

- How to run CI and CT bucket test:

  Default CI test bucket list:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=xx.xx.xx.xx tox -e default -- --argumentfile test_lists/HW_CI  redfish/  ipmi/
  ```

  Default CI smoke test bucket list:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=xx.xx.xx.xx tox -e default -- --argumentfile test_lists/CT_basic_run  redfish/  ipmi/
  ```

- Exclude test list for supported systems:

  ```
  Witherspoon:  test_lists/skip_test_witherspoon
  ```

  Using the exclude lists (example for Witherspoon)

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx -A test_lists/skip_test_witherspoon  redfish/ ipmi/
  ```

- Run IPMI tests via robot CLI interface:

  Running only out-of-band IPMI tests:

  ```
  $ robot -v IPMI_COMMAND:External -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx --argumentfile test_lists/witherspoon/skip_inband_ipmi  ipmi/
  ```

  Running only inband IPMI tests:

  ```
  $ robot -v IPMI_COMMAND:Inband -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx -v OS_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx -v OS_USERNAME:xxxx -v OS_PASSWORD:xxxx --argumentfile test_lists/witherspoon/skip_oob_ipmi  ipmi/
  ```

- Run GUI tests via robot CLI interface:

  By default, GUI runs with Firefox browser and headless mode. Example with
  Chrome browser and header mode:

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx -v GUI_BROWSER:gc -v GUI_MODE:header gui/test/
  ```

  Run GUI default CI test bucket:

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx --argumentfile test_lists/BMC_WEB_CI gui/test/
  ```

- Run LDAP tests via robot CLI interface:

  Before using LDAP test functions, be sure appropriate LDAP user(s) and
  group(s) have been created on your LDAP server. Note: There are multiple ways
  to create LDAP users / groups and all depend on your LDAP server. One common
  way for openldap is ldapadd / ldapmodify refer
  https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapadd For ldapsearch, refer to
  "https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch". Microsoft ADS: refer to
  https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/Microsoft-Active-Directory-Domain-Services-AD-DS

  Note: Currently, LDAP test automation for Redfish API is in progress. The
  format to invoke LDAP test is as follows:

  ```
  $ cd redfish/account_service/
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx -v LDAP_SERVER_URI:<ldap(s)//LDAP Hostname / IP> -v LDAP_BIND_DN:<LDAP Bind DN> -v LDAP_BASE_DN:<LDAP Base DN> -v LDAP_BIND_DN_PASSWORD:<LDAP Bind password> -v LDAP_SEARCH_SCOPE:<LDAP search scope> -v LDAP_SERVER_TYPE:<LDAP server type> -v LDAP_USER:<LDAP user-id> -v LDAP_USER_PASSWORD:<LDAP PASSWORD> -v GROUP_NAME:<Group Name> -v GROUP_PRIVILEGE:<Privilege>  ./test_ldap_configuration.robot
  ```

- Host CPU architecture

  By default openbmc-test-automation framework assumes that host CPU is based on
  the POWER architecture. If your host CPU is x86 add
  `-v PLATFORM_ARCH_TYPE:x86` variable setting to your CLI commands or set an
  environment variable:

  ```
  $ export PLATFORM_ARCH_TYPE=x86
  ```

**Jenkins jobs tox commands**

- HW CI tox command:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=xx.xx.xx.xx tox -e default -- --argumentfile test_lists/HW_CI  redfish/  ipmi/
  ```
