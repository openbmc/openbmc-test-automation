      "message": "If the only difference here is that we no longer consider \"OSStarted\" to indicate the host firmware has fully booted, I don\u0027t think that is POWER specific. We got agreement among the community that it was not used to indicate a complete boot of the system. It\u0027s just our old AC922 class systems that run OPAL did use it as an indication they had completed their boot. I think we should name this file something more generic and eventually make it the default.",
