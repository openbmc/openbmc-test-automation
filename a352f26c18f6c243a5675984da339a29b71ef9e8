When I executed this use case, I found that there were two residual sessions in OpenBMC. One is generated before the execution of the test case, and the other is generated by the call to Library bmc_redfish_utils.py WITH NAME redfish_utils in the bmc_redfish_resource.robot file during the execution of the test case. So can you provide an idea of how to implement it according to what you mentioned, I didn\u0027t think of how to modify it in this way",
